Rating with a scale of more than this number of classes demands a discrimination which does not yield an increase in reliability sufficiently great to make the increase worth while according to an arbitrary definition of such worthwhileness. Likewise, according to our definition, a rating scale with a fewer number of classes suffers from a loss of reliability greater than is allowed, due to coarseness of grouping. The graphic rating scale, although permitting as close a discrimination as possible, contributes but little to increased reliability over a 7-point scale. Group mental and scholastic tests which cover a range of score of a hundred or more points give an illusory impression of discrimination." From Psych Bulletin 22:12:00912.

Such rating scales can offer odd numbers of points, meaning that they have explicit middle alternatives, or they can offer even numbers of points, omitting the middle alternative. By examining four types of questions in six national or regional telephone surveys, this paper found that omitting the middle alternative and forcing respondents to pick a side compromised data quality, for questions presenting two conditions with middle option `about equally,' and for quasi-bipolar questions with middle option `fair.' In addition, omitting the middle alternative never helped improve data quality for a variety of unipolar questions. Lastly, there is a marginally significant improvement in terms of data quality for bipolar questions with middle option `neither good nor bad' when offering a follow-up asking whether they lean one way or the other or whether they are genuinely in the middle.},
