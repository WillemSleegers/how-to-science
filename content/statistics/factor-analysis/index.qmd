title: "Factor analysis"
---

This section is about the two types of factor analysis:

1.  Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)
2.  Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)

Each section consists of a best practices section in which I cover the different decisions you have to make to run the analysis. I cover the literature and offer a conclusion for each step that should be, to my knowledge, the best way to perform that step.

Other sections consist of an example of the analysis (with code), recommended reading, and a glossary.

Do note that both sections are still a work in progress.
