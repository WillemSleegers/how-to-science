"],["how-to-use-this-template.html", "1 How to use this template 1.1 Setup 1.2 Usage", " 1 How to use this template The goal of this template is to make it easy to get started on writing a bookdown book. The word ‘book’ might be a misnomer because you can also use it to write notes, a manual (similar to this bookdown), a thesis, and many other things. If you have enough time, the best way to get started is to read the bookdown book. For those in a hurry, we list the important steps below. 1.1 Setup Clone this template from GitHub. The easiest way to do this is to open RStudio and select File -&gt; New Project -&gt; Version Control -&gt; Git. The repository URL of this template is “https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/bookdown-template.” After entering this, and changing some of the other settings if you want to, click on Create Project. Next, go to the Build tab (next to Environment, History, and Connection) and click on “Build Book.” Done. The book is up and running! 1.2 Usage The template is in and of itself not interesting, so now you need to adapt the content. The first thing to adapt are the contents of ‘index.Rmd.’ You should change some of the information at the top of the file (between the two --- symbols). These are the YAML options and you can change them to alter the meta-information of the book or to change some of the settings. After changing the content of this file, you should start adding chapters. This template comes with a ‘chapters’ folder where you can store individual chapter files. You can simply take one of the example chapters and change the content. You should also change the file names, but in order for the book to include the chapter when you build it, you should change the contents of _bookdown.yml. Make sure to adapt the file paths in the rmd_files option so it refers to the new chapter. The order of these file paths also determines the order of the chapters in the book.

Note that this means this feature is not supported out of the box and that some setup is necessary if you start with a fresh install of the bookdown format. It is recommended to clone the files of this template so that you don’t have to worry about it. A foldable section can be created by placing text between two sets of three colons (:::) and specifying the .foldable class between two curly braces, like so: ::: {.foldable} &lt;button class=&quot;fold-button&quot;&gt;Show me more&lt;/button&gt; This is a foldable section. ::: This creates the following foldable section: Show me more This is a foldable section. By default is shows the “Show me more” text, followed by “Show me less” after clicking on it. This text could be changed to something else in the header.html file that can be found in the assets folder. For more information on custom blocks, see here.
