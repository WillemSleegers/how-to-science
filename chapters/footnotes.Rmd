# Footnotes (hoverable)

Standard markdown footnote syntax should work: 

`blah blah text^[contents of footnote]`

Which will create 
... blah blah text^[contents of footnote]

We have made these footnotes 'hoverable', so mouse-over should show their contents.
(We see this as a good but imperfect substitute for the 'tufte-style margin notes' from the our previousstyle.)
