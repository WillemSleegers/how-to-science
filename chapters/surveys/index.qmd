This chapter is about best practices and common issues in designing surveys.

As suggested in some review papers [e.g., @gehlbach2011], the construction of a new survey or scale is best done in several steps:

-   Review the literature to define the construct of interest and to find existing or related measures of the construct

-   Interview respondents to see whether respondents think the same way about the construct as you do

-   Reconcile potential differences between the literature review and the interview data

-   Develop items (see next sections for more details on how to best design items)

-   Validate with experts

-   Do cognitive pretesting to see how respondents understand and respond to each item

-   Run large-scaled reliability and validity tests

I will try to cover as many of these topics as possible. Currently, there is a chapter on response options and one containing some recommended readings.
