  abstract = {This paper analyzes the theoretical, pragmatic, and substantive factors that have hampered the integration between psychology and psychometrics. Theoretical factors include the operationalist mode of thinking which is common throughout psychology, the dominance of classical test theory, and the use of ``construct validity'' as a catch-all category for a range of challenging psychometric problems. Pragmatic factors include the lack of interest in mathematically precise thinking in psychology, inadequate representation of psychometric modeling in major statistics programs, and insufficient mathematical training in the psychological curriculum. Substantive factors relate to the absence of psychological theories that are sufficiently strong to motivate the structure of psychometric models. Following the identification of these problems, a number of promising recent developments are discussed, and suggestions are made to further the integration of psychology and psychometrics.},

  abstract = {Best Practices in Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is a practitioner-oriented look at this popular and often-misunderstood statistical technique. We avoid formulas and matrix algebra, instead focusing on evidence-based best practices so you can focus on getting the most from your data. Each chapter reviews important concepts, uses real-world data to provide authentic examples of analyses, and provides guidance for interpreting the results of these analysis. Not only does this book clarify often-confusing issues like various extraction techniques, what rotation is really rotating, and how to use parallel analysis and MAP criteria to decide how many factors you have, but it also introduces replication statistics and bootstrap analysis so that you can better understand how precisely your data are helping you estimate population parameters. Bootstrap analysis also informs readers of your work as to the likelihood of replication, which can give you more credibility. One chapter briefly reviews important issues around data cleaning and missing data, including evidence-based recommendations as to how to deal with important issues that are often not clearly discussed: random responding, outliers, missing data, etc. At the end of each chapter, the author has recommendations as to how to enhance your mastery of the material, including access to the data sets used in the chapter through his web site. Other resources include syntax and macros for easily incorporating these progressive aspects of exploratory factor analysis into your practice. The web site will also include enrichment activities, answer keys to select exercises, and other resources. The fourth "best practices" book by the author, Best Practices in Exploratory Factor Analysis continues the tradition of clearly-written, accessible guides for those just learning quantitative methods or for those who have been researching for decades.},
