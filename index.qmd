This is a book to organize my conclusions about topics in methodology and statistics.

The book is divided up into multiple sections. At this moment, there is a section on survey design and a section on statistics. The survey design section is about various issues pertaining to designing surveys, such as how to create items, what kind of response options to use, and so on. The statistics section is currently only about factor analyses, including both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.

More sections will be added in the future.
